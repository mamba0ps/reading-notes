# What Are Four Important Features to Look for in a Text Editor?

Choosing a text editor is a personal preference, but four important features include:

- **Code completion** — provides suggestions based on what you type, saving time and reducing typos.
- **Syntax highlighting** — colorizes code to improve readability and error-spotting.
- A good selection of **themes** — lets you customize background and text colors (e.g., dark mode to reduce eye strain).
- Support for **extensions** — add-ons that enhance functionality and allow the editor to grow with your needs.
