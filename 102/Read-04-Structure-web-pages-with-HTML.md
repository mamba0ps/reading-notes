# Structure web-pages with HTML


## HTML and its uses
**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is a **markup language** and the most basic building block of the Web. It is used to define the **meaning** and **structure** of web content.

- We use HTML because it adds *“markup”* to text, images, and other content so that web browsers can display them correctly.
- The **“Hypertext”** part refers to links that connect web pages within a website or between different websites. This is a key part of how the Web works.

##  3 main parts of an HTML element
The main parts that make up an HTML structure include:

- **Elements**, which are created using tags.  
  The element name (for example, `title`) is surrounded by `<` and `>`.
- **Attributes**, which add extra details to an element.
- **Content**, which is the text or media placed between the tags.

### Giving an element extra information

When you give an element extra information, it is called an **attribute**. Attributes change how an element behaves or looks.

## Semantic element 
A **semantic element** is an HTML element where the **meaning or purpose** is clear from the element itself, not just its appearance.

- For example, the `<h1>` element is semantic because it marks the text as a “top-level heading.”

Using semantic markup gives several benefits:

- **SEO:** Search engines treat content inside semantic elements as important.
- **Accessibility:** Screen readers use semantic elements to help visually impaired users navigate the page.
- **Cleaner Code:** Developers can quickly find meaningful sections of code.
- **Clear Purpose:** The element tells what kind of content should go inside it.
