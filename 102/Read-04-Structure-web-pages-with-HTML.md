**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is a **markup language** and is the most basic building block of the Web. It is used to define the **meaning** and **structure** of web content.

    We use HTML because it applies *“markup”* to annotate text, images, and other content so it can be displayed in a web browser.

    The **“Hypertext”** part refers to links that connect web pages within a website or between different websites, which is a fundamental part of the Web.



The core components that make up an HTML structure include:

    - **Elements**, which are created using tags.
    The element name (e.g., `title`) surrounded by `\<` and `\>`.
    - **Attributes**, which modify and adds more detail the element.
    - **Content**, which is the text or media inside the tags.

When you give an element extra information, it is called an **attribute**. Attributes configure or change the behavior of an element.


A **semantic element** is an HTML element where the **meaning or purpose** is clear from the element itself, not just how it looks.

    For example, the `\<h1>` element is semantic because it assigns the role of “top-level heading” to the text it wraps.



    Using semantic markup provides important advantages:

    - **SEO:** Search engines treat content inside semantic elements as important keywords.
    - **Accessibility:** Screen readers use semantic elements to help visually impaired users navigate.
    - **Cleaner Code:** Developers can easily find meaningful sections of code.
    
    - **Clear Purpose:** The element suggests the type of content expected inside it.
