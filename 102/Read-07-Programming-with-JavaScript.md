## Control Flow

**Control flow** refers to the order in which a computer runs the instructions (statements) in a program. Most of the time, code runs **one line at a time from top to bottom**. However, this normal flow can change when the program uses certain structures, such as **conditionals**, **loops**, or **functions**.

Because these structures can change the order in which code runs, you cannot always read a program strictly from the first line to the last line. Instead, you must pay attention to the program’s structure to understand **which parts of the code run, when they run, and under what conditions**.

## Functions

A **JavaScript function** is one of the basic building blocks of the language. A function is similar to a procedure or a recipe—it is a group of statements designed to **perform a task** or **calculate a value**.

In general, a function:
- Takes in some input (called **parameters**)
- Performs an action or calculation
- Produces an output that is related to that input

Functions help organize code, avoid repetition, and make programs easier to read and understand.

## Calling (Invoking) a Function

To **invoke** or **call** a function means to **run the code inside the function**. Simply defining a function gives it a name and explains what it should do, but **the code does not run until the function is called**.

For example, if a function named `square` has already been defined, calling it like this:

```js
square(5);
