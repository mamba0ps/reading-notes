# Mastering Markdown

If you have ever used a word processor like Microsoft Word, you are used to a "What You See Is What You Get" (WYSIWYG) system where you click buttons to format text. **Markdown** is different; it is a **lightweight markup language** that allows you to format plaintext documents using simple symbols. Created in 2004 by John Gruber, it has become one of the most popular ways to write for the web because it is designed to be **highly readable**, even if it hasn't been "rendered" into a final webpage yet.

When you write in Markdown, you save your work as a **.md or .markdown file**. A special program called a **Markdown processor** then takes that text and converts it into HTML so it can be viewed in a web browser. This makes Markdown incredibly versatile; people use it for everything from taking notes and writing emails to publishing entire books and technical documentation.

One of the biggest advantages of Markdown is its **portability**. Unlike proprietary file formats (like .docx) that might require specific expensive software, Markdown files can be opened and read by almost any application on any operating system. Because it is essentially just plain text, it is also **future-proof**, meaning you will still be able to read your notes decades from now even if today's apps no longer exist.

### Frequently Asked Questions

**What is Markdown?**
Markdown is a **lightweight markup language** used to add formatting elements to plaintext documents. It allows you to indicate how text should look (like bolding or headers) by adding specific characters directly into the document.

**Why do we use Markdown?**
We use it because it is **portable, platform-independent, and future-proof**. It is also much faster to use than a standard word processor once you learn the symbols, and it is supported across major platforms like GitHub and Reddit.

**What symbol will create a heading in Markdown?**
To create a heading, you add the **number sign (#)** in front of a word or phrase.

**How many do you need to create the largest heading?**
You need **one (#)** symbol for the largest, first-level heading.

**How many do you need to create the smallest heading?**
You need **six (######)** symbols for the smallest, sixth-level heading.

**When making text bold or italicized for emphasis, it is best practice to use which symbol?**
While both underscores and asterisks work, it is considered **best practice to use asterisks (*)** for maximum compatibility across different Markdown applications, especially when emphasizing the middle of a word.

**How do you create a link with Markdown?**
You enclose the **link text in brackets** and the **URL in parentheses** immediately after, like this: `[Text](URL)`.

**What are the three symbols you can use to create an unordered (bulleted) list with Markdown?**
You can use **dashes (-)**, **asterisks (*)**, or **plus signs (+)**. It is recommended to stick to one symbol throughout a single list for compatibility.

**Analogy for Understanding:**
Think of Markdown like a **recipe for a cake**. Writing in a word processor is like looking at the finished cake—it's pretty, but you can't see the individual ingredients easily. Markdown is the recipe itself: the text is the flour and sugar, and the symbols (like `#` or `*`) are the instructions telling the oven (the Markdown processor) exactly how to bake it into a beautiful webpage.
